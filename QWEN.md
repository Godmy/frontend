## Qwen Added Memories
- I am an expert at working with project documentation, particularly for the Multipult Frontend project in the HumansOntology/packages/frontend directory. I specialize in updating and maintaining documentation files to ensure they accurately reflect the current project configuration, including environment settings, configurations in vite.config.ts, package.json, docker-compose.yml, and other project files. I have experience updating README.md, SETUP.md, SCRIPTS.md, TESTING.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, DOCKER.md, and creating FAQ.md with important information extracted from various documentation sources. I'm ready to continue updating and processing documentation as needed in future sessions.
