# ADR 006: Performance Optimization Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The frontend application requires performance optimization to improve user experience, loading times, and overall efficiency. This analysis evaluates the current state and proposes strategies for optimization.

## Decision Drivers
- Improve user experience with faster loading times
- Meet performance metrics (Lighthouse score > 90, FCP < 1.5s, TTI < 3s)
- Optimize resource usage and bandwidth consumption
- Ensure smooth UI interactions for large datasets

## Current State Analysis

### Frontend Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Currently, no route-based code splitting is implemented; all routes are loaded together
- **Bundle Size**: No bundle analysis or tree-shaking optimizations identified in the configuration
- **Component Splitting**: No component-based code splitting for large modules
- **Images**: No specific image optimization (WebP, lazy loading) currently implemented
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Long lists (e.g., ConceptTree component) use simple `{#each}` loops without virtualization

### GraphQL Optimization
- **DataLoader Pattern**: Not identified in current implementation
- **Persisted Queries**: Not configured in Houdini GraphQL setup
- **Query Optimization**: No explicit field optimization patterns found
- **Query Batching**: Not implemented

### Performance Monitoring
- **Lighthouse Audit**: No configuration for Lighthouse testing identified
- **Web Vitals**: No performance metrics monitoring implemented
- **Performance Budgets**: No performance budget configurations found

## Considered Options

### Immediate Optimizations
1. Implement route-based code splitting with SvelteKit's built-in capabilities
2. Add lazy loading for non-critical routes/components
3. Optimize bundle size with bundle analyzer tool
4. Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

### Advanced Optimizations
1. Add DataLoader pattern for backend GraphQL resolvers
2. Implement persisted queries for production
3. Set up performance monitoring and Web Vitals tracking
4. Add image optimization and responsive image loading

## Implications

### Positive
- Significant improvement in loading times and user experience
- Better performance metrics and SEO rankings
- Reduced bandwidth consumption
- Improved scalability for large datasets

### Negative
- Additional complexity in codebase and build process
- Need for performance monitoring infrastructure
- Potential learning curve for virtualization implementation

## Recommendation

The performance optimization backlog item should remain as a high-priority task. Most optimizations identified in the backlog are not yet implemented, and the application would significantly benefit from implementing these performance improvements.

The current implementation follows basic SvelteKit patterns but lacks advanced performance optimizations that would benefit the user experience and scalability of the application.
