# ADR 005: Architecture Patterns in Frontend

## Status
Assessed

## Context
Evaluate the current architecture patterns in the frontend to ensure they follow best practices for Svelte applications, including component architecture, state management, and project structure.

## Decision Drivers
- Maintainability and scalability of the codebase
- Consistency in component patterns across the project
- Modern architecture practices alignment
- Developer experience and productivity

## Assessment Findings

### Current Architecture Patterns
- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)**: Project follows FSD architecture with clear separation into `entities`, `features`, `shared`, `widgets`, `pages`, `processes`, and `app` layers
- **Atomic Design**: UI components are organized using atomic design principles in `shared/ui` with `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`
- **Compound Components**: Pattern implemented using Svelte's `setContext`/`getContext` for parent-child component communication (e.g., Tabs/Tab components)
- **Store-Driven State Management**: Uses Svelte 5 `$state` runes in `.svelte.ts` files for store implementations
- **Render Props Pattern**: Implemented in components like FormFactory for flexible component composition
- **TypeScript Generics**: Used in components like FormFactory to provide type-safe APIs

### Structure Analysis
- **Entities**: Domain-focused modules (concept, dictionary, language, user) with `model` and `ui` subdirectories
- **Features**: Use-case-focused modules (auth, concept-management, etc.) with clear UI component separation
- **Shared**: Reusable cross-cutting concerns including UI atoms, molecules, organisms, configuration, and utilities
- **Widgets**: Presentation-focused components that compose other layers (header, navigation, language switcher)

## Conclusion

The frontend architecture demonstrates mature implementation of multiple best practice patterns:
1. Feature-Sliced Design for application structure
2. Atomic Design for UI components
3. Compound Component pattern for complex UI components
4. Store-oriented architecture with Svelte 5 Runes
5. Type-safe component patterns with TypeScript generics

The project consistently applies these patterns throughout the 81+ Svelte components, creating a maintainable and scalable architecture.

## Recommendation

The architecture patterns task should be marked as completed, as the project already implements modern Svelte architectural best practices. Future work should focus on documentation and consistency improvements rather than pattern implementation.
