## Description
Improve methodology for maintaining backlog according to Scrum principles. Create standardized templates and processes for more effective task management and better interaction with AI agents.

## User Story
As a team member, I want to have standardized backlog items with clear structure, consistent naming conventions, and proper Scrum methodology so that we can improve project planning, estimation, and tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standardized template for backlog items is implemented
- [ ] Consistent file naming convention is established  
- [ ] Improved prioritization methodology is implemented
- [ ] Enhanced status tracking is implemented
- [ ] Story points estimation system is integrated
- [ ] Instructions for AI agents working with backlog are created
- [ ] Existing backlog items are updated to follow new standards as needed

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All new backlog items follow standard template with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] File names follow [PRIORITY]_[CATEGORY]_[TOPIC].md format (e.g., P001_ENH_scrum_methodology.md)
- [ ] RICE or MoSCoW prioritization system is implemented
- [ ] Status tracking system is updated with consistent emojis
- [ ] Story points estimation is used consistently
- [ ] Documentation for AI agents is created and maintained

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create template for new backlog items
- [ ] Update file naming system across documentation
- [ ] Implement new prioritization methodology
- [ ] Update status tracking system with standardized emojis
- [ ] Train team on new methodology
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for AI agents
- [ ] Update existing backlog items to new format (starting with active ones)
- [ ] Create automated checks for format compliance

## Dependencies
- None (process improvement initiative)

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify new backlog items follow standards correctly
- [ ] Conduct trial sprint with new methodology
- [ ] Gather team feedback on new process
- [ ] Validate that AI agents can correctly parse new format

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Code/documentation reviewed and approved by team member
- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] Documentation updated and standardized
- [ ] Approved by product owner
- [ ] Team trained on new process

## Success Metrics
- 25% improvement in sprint planning speed
- 20% improvement in estimation accuracy
- Reduce unclear tasks in backlog to 0%
- Improved AI agent effectiveness when working with documentation
- 100% of team members are familiar with new methodology

## Notes
This task aims to standardize the backlog process and improve AI agent interaction with our documentation. The success of this task will enable better automation and AI-assisted development processes.
