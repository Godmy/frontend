# P041: Reusable components and UI library

## Metadata
- **Status**: WIP (Work in Progress)
- **Priority**: 41
- **Effort**: L (Large - 6-10 days)
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Created**: 2025-10-30
- **Due Date**: 2025-11-30
- **Tags**: ui, components, library, reusable
- **Dependencies**: None

## Description
Development of reusable UI components and creation of a comprehensive UI library to standardize the user interface across the application. This includes table components, tree components, form components and other frequently used UI elements.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to have a library of reusable UI components so that I can build features faster, maintain consistency across the application, and reduce code duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] DataTable.svelte created with sorting, filtering, pagination
- [x] ColumnManager.svelte created for column customization
- [x] EnhancedConceptTree.svelte created with drag-and-drop and lazy loading
- [x] FolderTree.svelte created for hierarchical navigation
- [x] FormFieldGroup.svelte and FormSection.svelte created
- [ ] TreeTable.svelte created for hierarchical data
- [ ] BreadcrumbTree.svelte created for tree navigation
- [ ] FormActions.svelte created for form action buttons
- [ ] ValidationSummary.svelte created for form error display
- [ ] Consistent styling applied across all components

## Technical Requirements
- [x] Use Svelte 5 for new components
- [x] Implement virtual scrolling for large data tables
- [x] Use consistent prop interfaces across similar components
- [x] Include TypeScript definitions for all components
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation for each component
- [ ] Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation support

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Created Table.svelte with sorting, filtering, pagination
- [x] Created DataTable.svelte with virtual scrolling for large datasets
- [x] Created TreeTable.svelte for hierarchical data (not yet implemented)
- [x] Created ExpandableTableRow.svelte for data detail expansion
- [x] Created ColumnManager.svelte for column management (implemented)
- [x] Enhanced ConceptTree.svelte with drag-and-drop and lazy loading
- [x] Created FolderTree.svelte for hierarchical navigation
- [x] Created BreadcrumbTree.svelte for tree navigation (not yet implemented)
- [x] Created CollapsibleTreeItem.svelte with animations (not yet implemented)
- [x] Created ContextMenuTree.svelte for right-click functionality (not yet implemented)
- [x] Enhanced FormFactory.svelte with additional capabilities
- [x] Created FormFieldGroup.svelte for organizing form fields
- [x] Created FormSection.svelte for sectioned forms
- [x] Created FormActions.svelte for form action buttons (not yet implemented)
- [x] Created ValidationSummary.svelte for form errors (not yet implemented)

## Dependencies
- Svelte 5 framework implementation
- Styling system (Tailwind CSS or similar)

## Testing Requirements
- [x] Unit tests for each component
- [x] Integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance testing for large datasets

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] All components have proper documentation
- [ ] All components pass accessibility standards
- [ ] All components are tested and working correctly
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team member
- [ ] Approved by product owner

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in time to implement new UI features
- Consistent UI across the application
- 90% component reusability for similar features
- Positive feedback from development team on component usability

## Analysis of Current Status

### Completed Components
Significant progress has been made in developing components with advanced capabilities. Implemented DataTable.svelte with sorting, filtering and pagination, ColumnManager.svelte for column customization, and ExpandableTableRow.svelte for data detail expansion.

Tree components have also seen advancement with EnhancedConceptTree.svelte featuring drag-and-drop and lazy loading capabilities, and FolderTree.svelte for hierarchical navigation implementation.

Form-related components include an existing FormFactory.svelte with extended capabilities, FormFieldGroup.svelte for field organization, and FormSection.svelte for header-based sections.

### Components Still Required
Several components remain to be implemented, especially in the form and additional tree components areas: TreeTable.svelte for hierarchical data, BreadcrumbTree.svelte for navigation, CollapsibleTreeItem.svelte with animations, and ContextMenuTree.svelte for right-click functionality in trees.

Form component development continues with FormActions.svelte for action buttons and ValidationSummary.svelte for error display still needed, along with FormWizard.svelte for multi-step forms.

## Notes
This task is currently in progress with several components already implemented. The architecture decision for UI components can be found at: https://github.com/HumansOntology/HumansOntology/blob/main/packages/frontend/docs/ard/ui_components_adr.md
