## Description
Implement comprehensive security measures and audit capabilities for the application, ensuring protection against vulnerabilities and compliance with data protection regulations.

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want to ensure the application is secure and compliant with privacy regulations so that user data is protected and the application meets legal requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Security audit of dependencies completed (npm audit fix)
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for API requests
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- [ ] Secure headers configured (helmet.js)
- [ ] Validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] XSS vulnerability assessment and fixes
- [ ] Clickjacking protection implemented
- [ ] Audit logging for critical actions implemented
- [ ] Authorization event logging implemented
- [ ] Dashboard created for change history review
- [ ] Alerts set up for suspicious activity
- [ ] GDPR compliance review completed
- [ ] Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages created
- [ ] "Right to be forgotten" functionality implemented
- [ ] Cookie consent banner added

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Use industry-standard security libraries
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Security testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Tasks
### Security Measures
- [ ] Conduct security audit of dependencies (npm audit fix)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API requests
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Configure secure headers (helmet.js)

- [ ] Add Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages
- [ ] Implement "right to be forgotten" functionality
- [ ] Add cookie consent banner

### Monitoring (Future Steps)
- [ ] Integrate Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Set up application performance monitoring (APM)

## Dependencies
- Authentication system implementation
- Logging infrastructure

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Compliance validation
- [ ] Audit log verification

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Compliance requirements satisfied
