# Improved Backlog Format Proposal

## Overview
The current backlog format has several good elements but can be enhanced to be more AI-friendly while remaining human-readable. The proposed format maintains the core structure while adding standardized metadata and consistent formatting.

## Core Principles
1. **Semantic Structure**: Use consistent, predictable markup that AI can parse
2. **Rich Metadata**: Include structured metadata for better context
3. **Standardized Content**: Consistent format across all tasks
4. **Machine-Readable**: Format that allows for automated processing
5. **Human-Friendly**: Maintains readability for humans

## Proposed Format for BACKLOG.md

### Main Backlog Table
```markdown
---
title: Scrum Backlog
description: Prioritized list of tasks for the HumansOntology project
last_updated: 2025-10-30
version: 2.0.0
---

# Scrum Backlog

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks planned for implementation in the project, organized by priority.

## Current Sprint Status
- Sprint: [Sprint Number/Name]
- Dates: [Start Date] - [End Date]
- Sprint Goal: [Brief description of sprint goal]

## Backlog Tasks

| ID | Priority | Status | Title | Effort | Owner | Due Date | Tags |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|-------|----------|------|
| P001 | 0 | NEW | [Improve Scrum methodology documentation](./backlog/P001_ENH_scrum_methodology.md) | L | Unassigned | 2025-11-15 | [process, documentation] |
| P069 | 69 | NEW | [Research svar-widgets/grid library](./backlog/P069_RES_svar_widgets_grid_research.md) | M | Unassigned | 2025-12-01 | [ui, research] |

### Legend
- **Statuses**: ðŸ†• NEW | ðŸ”„ WIP | ðŸ”„ PR (Partially Done) | âœ… DONE
- **Effort**: S (Small: 1-2 days) | M (Medium: 3-5 days) | L (Large: 6+ days)
- **Priority**: Higher numbers = higher priority
```

## Proposed Format for Individual Task Files

### Standard Template for Task Files
```markdown
---
task_id: "P001"
title: "Improve Scrum methodology documentation"
status: "NEW"
priority: 0
effort: "L"
owner: "Unassigned"
created: "2025-10-30"
due_date: "2025-11-15"
tags: ["process", "documentation", "scrum"]
dependencies: []
parent_task: null
related_tasks: ["P002", "P003"]

# P001: Improve Scrum methodology documentation

## Metadata
- **Status**: NEW
- **Priority**: 0 (highest)
- **Effort**: L (Large - 6+ days)
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Created**: 2025-10-30
- **Due Date**: 2025-11-15
- **Tags**: process, documentation, scrum
- **Dependencies**: None

## Description
Improve methodology for maintaining backlog according to Scrum principles. Create standardized templates and processes for more effective task management.

## User Story
As a team member, I want standardized backlog items with clear structure, consistent naming conventions, and proper Scrum methodology so that we can improve project planning, estimation, and tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standardized template for backlog items is implemented
- [ ] Consistent file naming convention is established
- [ ] Improved prioritization methodology is implemented
- [ ] Enhanced status tracking is implemented
- [ ] Story points estimation system is integrated
- [ ] AI agent instructions for working with backlog are created

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All new backlog items follow standard template
- [ ] File names follow [PRIORITY]_[CATEGORY]_[TOPIC].md format
- [ ] RICE or MoSCoW prioritization system is implemented
- [ ] Status tracking system is updated
- [ ] Story points estimation is used
- [ ] Documentation for AI agents is created

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create template for new backlog items
- [ ] Update file naming system
- [ ] Implement new prioritization methodology
- [ ] Update status tracking system
- [ ] Train team on new methodology
- [ ] Create AI agent documentation
- [ ] Update existing backlog items as needed

## Dependencies
- None (process improvement initiative)

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify new backlog items follow standards
- [ ] Conduct trial sprint with new methodology
- [ ] Gather team feedback

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Code/documentation reviewed and approved by team member
- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Approved by product owner

## Success Metrics
- 25% improvement in sprint planning speed
- 20% improvement in estimation accuracy
- Reduce unclear tasks in backlog to 0%
- Improved AI agent effectiveness

## Notes
This task aims to standardize the backlog process and improve AI agent interaction with our documentation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. YAML Frontmatter
- Standardized metadata at the top of each document
- Machine-readable format for AI processing
- Consistent fields across all tasks

### 2. Structured Table in Main Backlog
- Additional columns for effort, owner, due date, and tags
- More information available at a glance
- Better for AI analysis and processing

### 3. Consistent Task File Structure
- Every task follows the same template
- Predictable sections for AI to parse
- Standardized fields for all required information

### 4. Standardized Naming Convention
- Clear, consistent format for all files
- P001_CAT_task_topic.md format (P=Priority, CAT=Category, task_topic=snake_case)

### 5. Rich Tagging System
- Consistent tags for categorization
- Enables better search and filtering
- Facilitates AI-based recommendations

## Benefits

### For Humans
- Clear, structured format
- Consistent organization
- Easy to scan and understand
- Predictable location for specific information

### For AI
- Predictable structure for parsing
- Rich metadata for understanding context
- Standardized fields for data extraction
- Consistent format for all tasks
- Semantic markup for better understanding

## Implementation Plan
1. Update main BACKLOG.md file with new format
2. Create a template for new task files
3. Update existing task files to new format (starting with active ones)
4. Update README.md documentation
5. Create automated checks for format compliance
